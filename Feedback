Grade: 87

## Documentation ##
Good. Although you said how to simply get the game running in your README, you didn't include how to play the game. On the other hand, your in-code documentation is excellent

^ UPDATED to Good/Excellent. Next time be sure to include all instructions and your NAMES in your Readme

## Correctness ##
Excellent. The game ran as expected without any errors. I could not find a bug.

## Functionality / Features ##
Fair. Score is only shown at the end. Only one live player can play at a time. Timer and computer opponent is a nice addition.

## Style ##
Excellent. Code is very clear, elegant, and follows all standards.

## Design ##
Excellent. Clean class and API use, along with a clear separation of abstraction and concrete representation
